Our project is an interactive chatbot designed to guide consumers toward more sustainable and ethical shopping habits. By collecting user preferences such as product type, country, price, and language, it recommends sustainable brands and provides clear insights into their environmental and ethical impact. Unlike static platforms, our solution offers personalized guidance, helping users make informed choices rather than relying solely on ratings. The chatbot promotes conscious consumption, reduces unnecessary purchases, and supports ethical productionâ€”empowering individuals to drive environmental and social change. While its personalized approach and conversational design are strong features, we aim to enhance natural language understanding and improve the user interface for a more seamless and impactful experience.
